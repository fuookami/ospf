features:
  - title: Focus on Business
    details: Modular components encapsulate algorithmic complexity, enabling developers to concentrate on operational scenario modeling and strategy optimization, driving core logic design and iterative upgrades through a business-centric lens.

  - title: Out-of-the-Box Usability
    details: Preloaded with algorithm templates for standard business scenarios and pre-integrated elastic computing frameworks and visualization toolchains, it accelerates the deployment of fully functional optimization systems.

  - title: Domain-Driven Design
    details: Domain models built on bounded contexts dynamically map business rules to algorithmic parameters via aggregate roots, supporting continuous evolution and validation of complex strategies.

  - title: Unified Language
    details: A semantic alignment system bridges mathematical modeling, business metrics, and code implementation, ensuring end-to-end terminology consistency and traceability from requirements to execution.
